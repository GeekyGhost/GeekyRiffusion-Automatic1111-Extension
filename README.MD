WARNING! This version is going to have a lot of experimental tweaks. I would probably stick to the main branches. I'm going to be makig a lot of changes over time and experimenting. This was your heads up lol. 



## Installation
- Make sure `ffmpeg` is installed and the folder with the binaries is in your `PATH`
- Clone this repo inside your `/extensions` folder, or use the Install from URL functionality in the UI

## Usage

Select the `Riffusion Audio Generator` script before generating, and use the riffusion model.

You can also convert a whole folder of images to audio in the `Riffusion` tab.

## Prompt Travelling

If you want to prompt travel in the latent space as described by the authors, install this extension:

https://github.com/Kahsolt/stable-diffusion-webui-prompt-travel

It will output the results of runs in the `<SD>/outputs/(txt|img)2img-images/prompt_travel/` directory, and you can use the convert folder to audio functionality in the `Riffusion` tab to generate a single stitched-together audio file alongside the individual ones.

Here is a sample made by travelling in img2img mode from `jamaican rap` to `deep house, techno` with denoise `0.5` for `14` steps, and using the `og_beat.png` provided by the original authors as a base image:
